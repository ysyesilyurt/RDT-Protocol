Code Part has 6 files in the "src" folder: "source.py" "broker.py" , "router1.py" , "router2.py", "destination.py", "readings.txt"

First of all, scripts in the "src folder" needs to be deployed to their proper nodes on the network.

Then on each node: "chmod +x <script_name>" command needs to be executed to make the script executable by user.

Afterwards, since nodes' time are not synchronized, they are synchronized by binding them to the same NTP server. 
Following command is used for this purpose:
	"sudo ntpdate -u pool.ntp.org"

Then to initiate sending process:

	Firstly broker.py must be executed on b node:
	./broker.py

	Then router1.py, router2.py and destination.py scripts must be executed on r1, r2 and d nodes respectively:
	./router1.py
	./router2.py
	./destination.py

	Then on s node a file named "readings.txt" which contains data of sensor readings needs to be created for source script to read from and then send.
	Following bash script has been used for this purpose: 
		"for i in $(seq 1 11350); do echo DATA$i; done > readings.txt ; echo "DATA1" >> readings.txt"
	Also this "readings.txt" file is available under "src" folder, so it can be copied directly from there too.
	
	(The reason for us to use this file for sending is, it contains 102400 = 1024 * 100 bytes and 
		since 1024 bytes is sent 100 times (for experiment) this file is useful in that sense)

	Finally source.py script on s node needs to be executed:
	./source.py

	After this final execution source node will read 1024 bytes from readings.txt file and it will send it 100 times to be able to finish reading file

To show network delay for a node following command has been used:
	tc qdisc show dev [INTERFACE]

To delete network delay for a node following command has been used:
	tc qdisc del dev [INTERFACE] root

To add network delay for experiment following commands has been used:

	tc qdisc add dev [INTERFACE] root netem delay 1ms 5ms distribution normal
	tc qdisc add dev [INTERFACE] root netem delay 20ms 5ms distribution normal
	tc qdisc add dev [INTERFACE] root netem delay 60ms 5ms distribution normal
