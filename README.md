# RDT-Protocol
A unique implementation of a multihomed and pipelined Reliable Data Transfer Protocol (RDT) on a network topology as a Term Project for Data Communications and Networking Course

Development and experiments done on network topology, which is ```topology.xml```, through "Geni Portal" with slices.

## [Phase1](https://github.com/ysyesilyurt/RDT-Protocol/tree/master/phase1)
A multihomed network topology with five nodes, namely a source, a broker, two routers and a destination are implemented with UDP and TCP socket applications and some experiments with ```netem/tc``` done on it. Implementation done in Python. Phase1 report and its README can be viewed for further details.

## [Phase2](https://github.com/ysyesilyurt/RDT-Protocol/tree/master/phase2)
Same network topology extended and some experiments with ```netem/tc``` done on it.
More specifically, a unique multihomed and pipelined Reliable Data Transfer Protocol (RDT) over an unreliable channel has been implemented with Python. Phase2 report and its README can be viewed for further details.
